Feature: ListOperations

  Background:
    Given any graph

  Scenario: IN should work with nested list subscripting
    When executing query:
      """
      WITH [[1, 2, 3]] AS list
      RETURN 3 IN list[0] AS r
      """
    Then the result should be:
      | r    |
      | true |
    And no side effects

  Scenario: IN should work with nested literal list subscripting
    When executing query:
      """
      RETURN 3 IN [[1, 2, 3]][0] AS r
      """
    Then the result should be:
      | r    |
      | true |
    And no side effects

  Scenario: IN should work with list slices
    When executing query:
      """
      WITH [1, 2, 3] AS list
      RETURN 3 IN list[0..1] AS r
      """
    Then the result should be:
      | r     |
      | false |
    And no side effects

  Scenario: IN should work with literal list slices
    When executing query:
      """
      RETURN 3 IN [1, 2, 3][0..1] AS r
      """
    Then the result should be:
      | r     |
      | false |
    And no side effects

  Scenario: Execute n[0]
    When executing query:
      """
      RETURN [1, 2, 3][0] AS value
      """
    Then the result should be:
      | value |
      | 1     |
    And no side effects

  Scenario: Use collection lookup based on parameters when there is no type information
    And parameters are:
      | expr | ['Apa'] |
      | idx  | 0       |
    When executing query:
      """
      WITH $expr AS expr, $idx AS idx
      RETURN expr[idx] AS value
      """
    Then the result should be:
      | value |
      | 'Apa' |
    And no side effects

  Scenario: Use collection lookup based on parameters when there is lhs type information
    And parameters are:
      | idx | 0 |
    When executing query:
      """
      WITH ['Apa'] AS expr
      RETURN expr[$idx] AS value
      """
    Then the result should be:
      | value |
      | 'Apa' |
    And no side effects

  Scenario: Use collection lookup based on parameters when there is rhs type information
    And parameters are:
      | expr | ['Apa'] |
      | idx  | 0       |
    When executing query:
      """
      WITH $expr AS expr, $idx AS idx
      RETURN expr[toInteger(idx)] AS value
      """
    Then the result should be:
      | value |
      | 'Apa' |
    And no side effects

  Scenario: Fail at runtime when attempting to index with a String into a Collection
    And parameters are:
      | expr | ['Apa'] |
      | idx  | 'name'  |
    When executing query:
      """
      WITH $expr AS expr, $idx AS idx
      RETURN expr[idx]
      """
    Then a TypeError should be raised at runtime: ListElementAccessByNonInteger

  Scenario: Fail at runtime when trying to index into a list with a list
    And parameters are:
      | expr | ['Apa'] |
      | idx  | ['Apa'] |
    When executing query:
      """
      WITH $expr AS expr, $idx AS idx
      RETURN expr[idx]
      """
    Then a TypeError should be raised at runtime: ListElementAccessByNonInteger

  Scenario: Fail at compile time when attempting to index with a non-integer into a list
    When executing query:
      """
      WITH [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] AS list, 3.14 AS idx
      RETURN list[idx]
      """
    Then a SyntaxError should be raised at compile time: InvalidArgumentType
